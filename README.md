# DisPlace Plugin
This is a modification of [MakePlacePlugin](https://github.com/jawslouis/MakePlacePlugin) for personal use. I make no assurances that this will work or that I will keep it updated as I mainly just wanted to enable features that were disabled in makeplace and enable the plugin for the current version of FFXIV.
A plugin to automatically save and load housing furniture layouts for FFXIV. It can also import/export layouts from the [MakePlace](https://jawslouis.itch.io/makeplace) program since it uses the same file format.

## Installation

* You will need to use the [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) to run the game. This allows third-party plugins (such as this) to be used.
* Open the settings window by using the command `/xlsettings` in the chat, or by hitting `Esc` and selecting Dalamud Settings.
* Click on the "Experimental" tab
* Copy the following url into a new line on the Custom Plugin Repositories section: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drakansoul/DisPlace/master/DisPlacePlugin.json
* Click on the `+` button. Make sure the new entry has "Enabled" checked.
* Click the "Save and Close" button
* Open the plugins window by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat, or hit `Esc` and select Dalamud Plugins
* Search for "DisPlace Plugin" and click "Install"

## Usage
Type `/displace` to open the plugin screen. Most functions are only available when in Rotate Furniture mode (Housing -> Indoor/Outdoor Furnishings. Click on the Rotate button).

## Credits
[MakePlacePlugin](https://github.com/jawslouis/MakePlacePlugin) for making a great plugin.
This plugin builds upon the foundation laid by 3 other great plugins: [HousingPos](https://github.com/Bluefissure/HousingPos), [BDTH](https://github.com/LeonBlade/BDTHPlugin) and [HouseMate](https://github.com/lmcintyre/Housemate). The UI in particular borrows heavily from HousingPos.
